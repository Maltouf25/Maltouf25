# Introducing Myself

Hello, I'm **[Your Name]** — a Data Science student at **Telecom Paris** with a passion for **Artificial Intelligence** and its real-world applications. I love exploring data, building predictive models, and diving into the latest AI research. 

---

## What I Do

- **Data Exploration & Visualization**  
  I enjoy turning raw data into meaningful insights. I use Python libraries like `pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib` or `Seaborn` to explore datasets and create intuitive visualizations.

- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**  
  From classic regression models to neural networks, I’m excited about designing, training, and deploying predictive models. I primarily work with frameworks like `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, and `PyTorch`.

- **Research & Experimentation**  
  I’m always learning and experimenting with cutting-edge AI techniques — from natural language processing to reinforcement learning.
